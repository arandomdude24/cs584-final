# cs584-final
Final project for CS 584: Natural Language Processing

In this project I perform a multi label sentiment classification on a data set of tweets using 3 different neural network models
to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each model.

Models created & used
1. Simple Recurrent Neural Network
2. Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network
3. 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network
